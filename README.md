# Retail-Store-Sales
A Retail Store Sales Dashboard is a visual report that shows how a retail shop is performing in terms of sales. It helps track important details like total sales, profit, number of orders, and best-selling products. By using charts and tables, it makes data easy to understand and helps in quick decision-making.
